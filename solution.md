- For understanding a problem we can use this format, first we define the problem statement, what we understand, then the observations and input values and constraints. Observe the examples and make notes on them, try and classify the problem, break it down into simple understandable solution by human standards, how would you solve it, then expand on it and make the most basic solution and understand its TC. Then think of how you can improve on it, if it's possible or not but don't spend too long in the learning process, spend max 15 minutes thinking out a solution and if it doesn't come, look at the solution and try to understand that. 
- Then we can start defining the solution, note down the steps, edge cases and key points.
